# Code Quality Intelligence Agent

**Overview:**

The **Code Quality Intelligence Agent (CQIA)** is a multi-agent system designed to automatically evaluate the quality of source code.  
It combines **static analysis, AST parsing, concurrent multi-agent evaluation, and a RAG-powered chatbot** to provide deep insights into your project‚Äôs maintainability, security, and reliability.

---

## üîç Overview

CQIA leverages **five specialized agents**, each targeting a critical aspect of code quality:

1. **Code Duplication Agent**  
   Detects redundant or repeated logic across files and modules, improving maintainability.

2. **Security Agent**  
   Flags unsafe functions, insecure dependencies, and potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Performance Agent**  
   Highlights inefficient loops, heavy memory usage, and resource bottlenecks.

4. **Reliability & Fault Tolerance Agent**  
   Reviews exception handling and recovery strategies to ensure system resilience.

5. **Complexity Agent**  
   Uses AST-driven structural analysis (cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth) to measure readability and maintainability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. **Ingestion & Payload Creation**
- Source files are ingested automatically.  
- Each file is transformed into a **payload** containing:
  - **Raw Code** ‚Äì original source for direct inspection.
  - **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** ‚Äì structural representation of the code.
  - **Metadata** ‚Äì file paths, function boundaries, and contextual info.

### 2. **Concurrent Multi-Agent Analysis**
- The payload is sent to all five agents **concurrently**, ensuring faster evaluations.  
- Each agent produces issue reports specific to its domain.  

### 3. **RAG Chatbot**
- A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** is integrated for interactive exploration.  
- It leverages embeddings of raw code, AST fragments, and metadata to:
  - Describe project folder structures.  
  - Summarize detected issues.  
  - Provide natural language insights.  

### 4. **Report Generation**
- All results are aggregated into a **comprehensive quality report**, combining duplication, security, performance, reliability, and complexity metrics.

## üìä Output

- **Structured JSON Reports** for each agent.  
- **Consolidated Multi-Agent Report** summarizing overall code quality.  
- **Interactive Chatbot** to query project structure and issues in natural language.
